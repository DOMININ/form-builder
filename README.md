React Frontend Engineer Test Task: Form Builder with Drag-and-Drop, Export/Import Functionality
Objective:
Develop a form builder application using React that allows users to dynamically create forms using drag-and-drop components. The application should also support exporting and importing form configurations.

Requirements:

Core Features:

- Implement drag-and-drop functionality for form elements (e.g., text input, checkbox, radio buttons, dropdown).
- Enable users to configure properties for each form element (e.g., label, name, options for dropdowns).
- Provide a preview mode to see the form as it would appear to end-users.
- Implement form validation (e.g., required fields).

Export/Import Functionality:

- Allow users to export the form configuration as a JSON file.
- Implement an import feature enabling users to upload and apply a form configuration from a JSON file.

UI/UX Design:

- Ensure the application has a user-friendly interface.
- The application should be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile browsers.

Code and Project Structure:

- Use the latest React hooks for state management.
- Structure the project clearly and logically.
- Include comments and documentation for key components and functionalities.

Bonus (Optional):

- Add the ability to save forms and their configurations in local storage.
- Implement additional form fields (e.g., date picker, file upload).
- Integrate a simple backend (e.g., Node.js) to demonstrate form submission.

Deliverables:

- Source code pushed to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket).
- A README file with:
-
    - Instructions on how to run the application.
-
    - A brief explanation of the application structure and key components.
-
    - Any additional information necessary for evaluating the application.

Evaluation Criteria:
Functionality: The application meets the core features and requirements.
Code Quality: Clean, readable, and well-structured code.
UI/UX Design: The application is intuitive and easy to use.
Creativity and Problem-Solving: Implementation of the bonus features and how challenges were addressed.
